Hey FellaðŸ‘‹ My Name is **Priyank Negi**. I am learning and exploring new stuff and writing about my interests in topics where AI skills could be leveraged and entrepreneurial opportunities could be created.
I believe in learning by doing stuff instead of the conventional approach of learning everything but doing nothing! Lots of Experimentation and Project-based learning is what I go and by following these amazing courses curated by the[fast ai](https://www.fast.ai/) team, Jeremy Howard and Syllvian Gugger made deep learning seem so easy to build stuff on top of our ideas, so I highly recommend checking out these courses as they are excellent to get started and advance in the field of AI. 
**Thank you!! and u can reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PriyanK_7n) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyank-negi-707019195)**
