Hey Fella My Name is **Priyank Negi**, I am learning ,explore new stuff and writing on my interests a about topics where AI Skills could be leveraged and Entrepeunership could be created.
I believe in Learning by doing and also being curious throughout the process.
I think Privacy is essential in this digital age and AI should be Responsibly used. I also care deeply about the essence of Data Ethics in Building great AI Systems followed with responsible use of AI Systems and Data Ethics is Key in building great AI systems. I am always curious and awed by the self driving software of Tesla and Comma AI producing Cars that can tackle almost every situation.

**I beleive in learning by doing Stuff instead of the conventional approach of learning everything but actually doing Nothing!**
I love to experiment with stuff and beleive in Project based learning so i am not a Computer major  myself currently pursuing BTech in Electronics & Comm so by following these amazing Courses curated by fast ai team Jeremy howard and syllvian gugger that made DL so easy to actually build stuff on top of our ideas , so I highly recommend checking out these courses as they are excellent to get started and advance in the Feild of AI  [fast.ai's](https://www.fast.ai/)
