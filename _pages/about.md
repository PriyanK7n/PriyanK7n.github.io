Hey Fellaüëã My Name is **Priyank Negi**. I am a first-year graduate student at the Boston University College of Engineering, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Data Analytics. I completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree, focused in Electronics and Communication Engineering, in New Delhi, India. I am learning and exploring new stuff and writing about my interests in topics where AI skills could be leveraged and entrepreneurial opportunities could be created.

Throughout my undergraduate term of 4 years, I was actively involved in the ML and Data Science domain and gained technical experience through internships, global competitions, research work, and academic and community-aided projects. Apart from this, I have experience in leadership and volunteering positions in and outside of school. I find myself well in international and interdisciplinary Teams; I am also a team player in groups but am also very comfortable working independently.

Being an AI enthusiast, I enjoy exploring, researching topics, and leveraging AI skills that create entrepreneurial opportunities. I believe in learning by doing and remaining curious throughout the process instead of the conventional approach of learning everything but doing nothing! Lots of Experimentation and Project-based learning are what I go by!
I am also a big believer in the importance of Data Ethics in developing excellent AI systems and look forward to working with diverse people from interdisciplinary fields to create solutions that utilize data and make a societal impact.
