    "- We Can upload a CT Scan Image and Our Model `Covify` will predict on that image wether  the image uploaded is of a Covid Infected person or not.\n",
    "- When we `Click the Classifiy button `the model gives a softmax probability of the decision it made and how strongly it tries to put forward its integrity \n",
    "- We can then also `click on the Magic Button` that shows a heat map of all the activations in the image uploaded that tells us which all activations influenced the model to take certain decisions.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- > Deep learning, which is a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data, without the need for manual feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > We have used CT scan images to not sacrifice on quality but also to improve speed of data diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- >In order to combat COVID the Current need of the hour is building Medical Diagnosis Support Systems that are Fast, Reliable, Efficient, and Effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- >Conventional Covid-19 tests that is PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test are time consuming and also leads to much more False-Negative and False Positive predictions\n",
    "- > We have to send the sample of PCR  to the labs which are sometimes in faraway locations that  is far time consuming\n",
    "- > Sometimes When the doctors and Radiologists are not available at that time we can   generate a preliminary diagnosis \n",
    "- > Application of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis in the medical field have recently gained popularity i.e, have become far more essential in early detection \n",
    "- > Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are heavily needed to combat the disease so that more and more time should be invested in Disease Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- > Note: link to [link to my notebook](https://jovian.ai/priyank7n/minor-test-run) should also work fine."
