    "- We can upload a `CT Scan Image,` and our model Covify will `predict` whether the image uploaded is of a Covid Infected person or not.\n",

    "- When we click on the `Magic Button,` it shows a `heat map` of all the activations in the image that influenced the model to make certain decisions.\n"

    "-  Deep learning, a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data without the need for manual feature extraction.\n",

    "- Conventional Covid-19 tests that, is PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test are time-consuming and also leads to much more False-Negative and False Positive predictions\n",
    "-  We have to send the sample of PCR  to the labs, which are sometimes in faraway locations that  is far time consuming\n",
    "-  Sometimes, When the doctors and Radiologists are not available at that time, we can   generate a preliminary diagnosis \n",
    "-  Application of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis in the medical field have recently gained popularity, i.e., have become far more essential in early detection \n",
    "-  Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are heavily needed to combat the disease, so more and more time should be invested in Disease Control"
