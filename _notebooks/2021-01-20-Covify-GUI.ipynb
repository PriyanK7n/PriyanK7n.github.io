    "- We can upload a `CT Scan Image` and our model Covify will `predict` wether  the image uploaded is of a Covid Infected person or not.\n",
    "- When we click the `Classify button` the model gives a softmax probability of the decision it made and how strongly it tries to put forward its integrity.\n",
    "- When we click on the `Magic Button` it shows a `heat map` of all the activations in the image that  influenced the model to take certain decisions.\n"

    "-  Deep learning, which is a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data, without the need for manual feature extraction.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Conventional Covid-19 tests that is PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test are time consuming and also leads to much more False-Negative and False Positive predictions\n",
    "-  We have to send the sample of PCR  to the labs which are sometimes in faraway locations that  is far time consuming\n",
    "-  Sometimes When the doctors and Radiologists are not available at that time we can   generate a preliminary diagnosis \n",
    "-  Application of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis in the medical field have recently gained popularity i.e, have become far more essential in early detection \n",
    "-  Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are heavily needed to combat the disease so that more and more time should be invested in Disease Control"
